<P>
This document is to explain how our setup works.  The environment is
web based so you use a standard web browser to interface with our
judging system.  When you submit a problem, we do a bunch of things to
try to make sure your code is safe to run.  The first thing we do is
look for ``bad words'' that may indicate you are trying to do
something you shouldn't be doing.  These things include reading files,
running assembly code, connecting to the network, etc.  The following
is a list of all of these words:

<UL>
<LI>fork
</LI>
<LI>exec
</LI>
<LI>open
</LI>
<LI>system
</LI>
<LI>fstream
</LI>
<LI>socket
</LI>
<LI>accept
</LI>
<LI>listen
</LI>
<LI>connect
</LI>
<LI>mmap
</LI>
<LI>__asm__
</LI>
</UL>
Currently our program is very dumb about how it looks through your
code.  If it finds these words anywhere, it will flag the problem as
incorrect and refuse to even compile it.  This includes comments, so
the following code would be considered illegal even though it is
harmless:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\begin{lstlisting}
// should I eat with a fork or spoon?
\end{lstlisting}">
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="\begin{lstlisting}
execute()
\end{lstlisting}">
<BR>

<P>
After we do this check, we remove all the files you have included and
replace them with a predefined set of library files.  If you try to
access files outside those provided, you will come across problems.
Here is the list of files by language:

<UL>
<LI><EM>C</EM>-assert.h, ctype.h, float.h, limits.h, malloc.h,
	math.h, stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h
</LI>
<LI><EM>C++</EM>-algorithm, bitset, cassert, cctype, cfloat,
	climits, cmalloc, cmath, cstdlib, cstdio, cstring, iomanip,
	iterator, list, map, new, queue, set, stack, stdexcept, string
</LI>
<LI><EM>Java</EM>-java.lang.*, java.io.*, java.util.*, java.math.*
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
When your program runs, we send all input to stdin and receive all
output from stdout.  We ignore any output sent to stderr, so we
suggest you send any debugging output there so you don't have to worry
about removing that before submitting.

<P>
Because of the bytecode nature of Java, people need to be aware of
several additional mechanisms if they are going to code in that
language:

<UL>
<LI>Do not make public classes.  If you do so, the compiler will
	expect the file to be named the same as your class name and
	our program can't possibly be expected to know the name of the
	class you are trying to run.
</LI>
<LI>The class in the file that contains the main() method must
	also be named Main.  This just makes it easier for our system
	to locate the main method and the class it is associated with.
</LI>
<LI>Put all your classes in a single file.  This should allow
	the upload interface to work well no matter what kind of
	solution you come up with.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The possible responses from the judge are:

<OL>
<LI>Accepted as correct
</LI>
<LI>Forbidden word in source (trying to open()) files, etc.)
</LI>
<LI>Undefined file type (can't determine which compiler to use
	from file e.g., .txt)
</LI>
<LI>Compile error
</LI>
<LI>Exceeds time limit
</LI>
<LI>Incorrect output (problem gives wrong answer)
</LI>
<LI>Format error (problem gives right answer, but does not meet
	output specifications)
</LI>
<LI>Runtime error (program crashes e.g., seg fault or uncaugt
	exception)
</LI>
<LI>Unknown error (catch all for contingencies-shouldn't see
	this)
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Make sure your C/C++ programs return 0 at the end.  For some reason,
gcc returns a failure code to the operating system if you do not
include that statement at the end of your successful runs.

<P>
we offer contestants the opportunity to compile their programs using
the same compiler as the server since its quite possible that some
contestants are using different compilers that may accept
(non-standard) syntax that our compiler doesn't accept.  We will
return any errors that our compiler generates so that contestants can
see exactly the problems we see with their code.

<P>
Please do not use the test compile as your main compilation tool,
since we do not return an executable and the compilation process
competes with other processes on the web server.  We don't want the web
interface to slow down because too many people are hitting the
compilation.  We anticipate this being used as a last minute check
before the program is submitted for judging.  This should eliminate any
compilation errors from contestants because they can always check
before submission.

<P>
Here is the URL for the setup:

  HREF="http://jacob.css.taylor.edu/~tlitwill/test/TestContest">http://jacob.css.taylor.edu/~tlitwill/test/TestContest</A></TT>
</LI>

<P>
We are using gcc 3.4.4 and Sun's 1.5.0_02 Java JDK.  We can give you more
detailed version information if you need it.  Hopefully, this
shouldn't be any type of problem since you shouldn't need any esoteric
features of any language.
