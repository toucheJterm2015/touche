The content of the old README has been moved to /documentation/symbolicLinksSetup.

Everything you might want to know about the state of the project is within the documentation folder. We recommend developers read aNoteAboutTheStateOfTheTests, bugs, jails documentation, the symbolicLinksSetup, and the newest Installation-And-Setup-Instructions (currently Version 3). You can read the old Installation-And-Setup-Instructions, but those are there more for legacy than because you need them. The current version is sufficient on its own.

People who are using the code and running contests probably only need the Installation and Setup Instructions and the symbolic links setup from within the documentation folder.

In the most recent updates, we began writing a testing framework for Touche so it is easy to catch if updates break things. Today (Jan. 23, 2015) it is still incomplete and our class has ended. However, all of the testing python files are pretty well commented (which tests fail and what we expect) and the listOfTests (found in the /testing/tests folder - intended to be a checklist of all the tests the contest will need in order to make sure EVERYTHING works, including atypical user input) contains notes on what is and is not tested for yet. Feel free to add anything we left out. Ideally, in the end, that will be not only a list of things that should be tested, but a list of things that have been tested and are tested for, to maintain good communication with all future developers.

That should be all you need to know. Happy coding.
