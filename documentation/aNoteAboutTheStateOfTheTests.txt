Things are broken.  We were unable to leave it in a workable state (sorry).
Ideally all of the tests would be in python, but some of them are still html.
(Html files can be opened by the selenium firefox web add on and exported
to python from there.)  We realized too late that file uploads do not work
with the current architecture.  The tests need a browser to work (selenium
just manipulates a browser - it does not actually do web requests and such.)
A headless browser called phantomjs is installed on the server for this 
purpose.  For some reason this browser does not allow file uploads via
the python "sendKeys" function.  It seems as though this is the only python
way to upload files.  Therefore most of the tests do not work after being 
exported.  We figured this out later than we should have so some tests that 
require file uploads have been exported and some have not.  The ones that
have not been exported to python are much easier for you to edit (via the
selenium ide (firefox add on)).  

There is a listOfTests.txt (in testing/tests) that details what we thought all of the functionality 
should be.
An x at the beginning of the a line in that document indicates that we think there is 
a test for that.
