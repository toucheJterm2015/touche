BUGS
There are more bugs in geislers github under "issues".  Some of them
overlap with these, but none are complete duplicates. (and some of these
only apply to the j-term branch and not his master)

Team filter not set correctly if not a POST - judge/submissions.inc 
line 52

judge/clarification_response_form.php has not been bootstrap-ed

While editing a problem, pressing the "edit" button for another problem 
breaks things (and other pages too - sites, teams, etc.) - meaning that
if you have the edit page for a problem open do NOT hit the edit button
for a different problem.

Once a problem description file has been uploaded, it sometimes cannot be changed

Problem files cannot be uploaded from the problem creation screen (only 
from the problem edit screen) (not sure whether to call this a bug or not)

Editing a problem removes the problem description file sometimes

Entering just a PDF file for a problem description (and not an html)
gives an error at contest start, and it will not open the pdf from the 
player view

You can create 2 teams with the same username (and that's bad - it breaks
the login functionality for those two teams in weird ways)

SQL injection opportunities are everywhere - when creating a contest you cannot have 
many special characters in the name (semi-colon for example).  This is a problem in many places
such as contest name, and many other places in the admin pages.

Root password and contest skeleton password have to be the same - the same variable 
is used for the password for these two different roles while creating a contest.  Therefore 
if the passwords are different then it breaks (meaning don't change the database password).

Having more than one pop-up on a page is bad.  They overlap so that you can only see the top
one.
