We might eventually combine all the admin tests into one huge file to avoid logging in every single time, and so a final destructor can take everything away again. In case we don't get that far, here is the intended order for running tests

1. create contest
2. create contest 2
3. login (1)
4. change password
5. login (2)
6. details (presence & functionality)
7. problems (p&f)
8 - 15. go down the navbar in order.
