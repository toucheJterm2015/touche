We might eventually combine all the admin tests into one huge file to avoid logging in every single time, and so a final destructor can take everything away again. In case we don't get that far, here is the intended order for running tests

x means tests have been written for that page, o means not.

1. create contest
2. create contest 2
3. login (1)
4. change password
5. login (2)
6. details (presence & functionality. Sometimes these are combined, sometimes separate.)
7. problems (p&f)
8 - 15. go down the navbar in order.
16. page for details of a contest which has been re-judged (option on Misc page)
